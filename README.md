Grone Theme for Tiny Tiny RSS by Cas
============

A theme for tt-rss that mimics the Google Reader style, based on the 'cozy'
list style, enabling the browsing of many feed headlines at once.

The theme is designed around these tt-rss preference settings:
 - Automatically expand articles in combined mode: _disabled_
 - Combined feed display: _enabled_

Notable changes:
 * Removed counts from feedlist
 * Replaced/removed feedlist category icons
 * Force the feed excerpt to no longer wrap but still auto-expands as required
 * Removed the feed name tag due to inability to control it's size/spacing
 * Overall font size is 13px and spacing is reduced
 * Hide publish button
