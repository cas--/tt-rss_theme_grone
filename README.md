Grone Theme for Tiny Tiny RSS
============

A theme for tt-rss that mimics the Google Reader style, based on the 'Cozy'
list layout, enabling the browsing of many feed headlines at once.

The theme is designed around these TT-RSS preference settings:

    Automatically expand articles in combined mode: Disabled
    Combined feed display: Enabled

Notable changes:
 * Replaced/removed feedlist category icons
 * Force the feed excerpt to no longer wrap but still auto-expands as required
 * Removed the feed name tag due to inability to control it's size/spacing
 * Overall font size is 13px and spacing is reduced
 * Hide publish button

Use hide_unread_count plugin if you wish to hide counters
